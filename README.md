Abortire in Italia *Abortion in Italy*
===

In Italy, under the Law, abortion is legal during the first 90 days of pregnancy. 
Medical and paramedical personnel can be opposed to abortion on moral or religious grounds, they are called *conscientious objectors* and can be exempted from performing or assisting in the procedure of an abortion.  
In 2014, the European Committee of Social Rights declared that Italy is violating the law and an important human right, because 70% of Italian Gynecologists are conscientious objectors. Having an abortion in Italy it’s becoming more and more difficult, women has to travel from region to region or to another country in order to find a safe hospital structure, in the meantime the number of illegal abortions is rising.
As women and Italian citizens can we do something to enforce our rights and help women to find a safe hospital structure?
Abortireinitalia.it is a web app, an open data platform, where women who are living in Italy can find verified information about where to have an abortion, where to purchase the morning after pill, and insights on health and sexuality, with the aim of making women more aware of their own rights.
The platform also aim to help hundreds of Italian activists and volunteers that are fighting for women’s rights, providing a “digital hub” where they can coordinate actions and data nationwide. Operators will be in fact able to use abortireinitalia.it to enter the data they gather about which structures guarantee abortion.
We believe technology has the power to solve problems like never before; the Internet is nowadays the first place where citizens and patients look for information about health. We think the italian government and public administration are failing to acknowledge the role of the Web as the first interface between them and the citizens. Lacking official and trusted information, users and patients are left on their own.
